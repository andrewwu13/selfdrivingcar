This is an interactive simulation of a self-driving car controlled by a neural network, built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The project visually demonstrates how a car can navigate a road using virtual sensors and a simple AI model trained in real-time.
I've used basic JS, CSS, HTML concepts and a simple single-layered neural network to control the car.

Features: 
- Road Generation
- Simple feedforward neural network
- Simulated LIDAR-like sensors
- Real-time network visualization
- Canvas API animation
